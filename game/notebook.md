## Notes
*Use this space to record your findings and deductions...*

1. Clue:

The investigation leads back to the shops.

Hint: You'll need to go back several directories to reach this location.
Remember that you can use multiple '../' to go up multiple levels:
- 'cd ..'    goes up one level
- 'cd ../..' goes up two levels
- and so on...

Location of the crime is still unknown - the room must have been empty when it happened...
