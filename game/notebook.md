## Notes
*Use this space to record your findings and deductions...*

1. Clue:

The investigation leads back to the shops.

Hint: You'll need to go back several directories to reach this location.
Remember that you can use multiple '../' to go up multiple levels:
- 'cd ..'    goes up one level
- 'cd ../..' goes up two levels
- and so on...

2. Investigation Conclusion:

Your investigation has led you to the truth - this empty room is where it all happened!

Your careful detective work has paid off. The empty state of this room matches 
witness accounts - no one was around when the crime occurred. This must be 
where the murderer carried out their plan!
